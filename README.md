# TimestampEncoder
JavaScript project to encode ISO dates to Base32 numbers.
Also has some more exotic conversions into human-readable time codes for use in production/warehouse environments.

This project is a bit of a pet of mine. To see it in action, there's a live code example at its home on 
[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/iLikeToBeAnonymous/pen/eYdqVow). That's where the majority of the testing and 
development actually takes place, and unfortunately that's also where the most up-to-date code lives.
